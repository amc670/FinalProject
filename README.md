# FinalProject
## The site is able to be used without a registration key once per day. It is recommended that you go into the code and add your own registration key (which can be obtained from https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/). To do this first download the files and then go into the script.js file. Proceed to scroll to the bottom to find where the registration key is needed. Uncomment the piece of code, paste in your registration key, save the file, and then launch the application from the files downloaded on to your computer. After all of that you should have a functioning application.
### A little sidenote. Utilites and Wholesale trade dont show graphs because the BLS doesnt havent any data on them even though they are listed as a supersector. Until they add data, the graphs for those two wont show.
